Change switches from primary prediction -> intended secondary.. else could be to late.
secondary is defined to be sensors that can be reached due to single error.

reserve 'stopping distance' past secondary.
When hit primary:
  - release last reservation, until current sensor
When hit secondary: 
  - stop. 
  - wait until primary cannot be missed.
  - release last reservation, keep current secondary reservation.

  - Reroute.


If miss primary:
  - Continue (cuz we have reservation past secondary)



-- DONE?
Remove_all_reservation_and_get_new(predictions + $last sensor)
  - if can get new reservation involving $predictions
      - remove all current
      - call reseve all each prediciton
      - return OK
  - else:
      - do nothing
      - return error
